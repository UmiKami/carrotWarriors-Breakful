# Details

This is the node express backend for the front-end. The deployment service, render.com, allows us to choose which branch we want to deploy. This is why we are making the backend on a separate branch. The original backend was not satisfactory and had many flaws hence why it was never committed it. 

# Purpose

1. Fall back to store user breaks in case the google API stops working.
2. Try new things out.
